# Tile Packs

This plugin serves as a collection of tile packs you can add and remove quickly and easily, for content all over the game.

These tiles do not interfere with your normal ground markers, they are saved separately.

If you have tiles you would like added, create an issue including the ground markers.
You can export the ground markers from Runelite by right-clicking the minimap orb.
Use this tool to see double-check your exported tiles. https://runelite.net/tile/

I've created a discord for anyone who wants to chat about, or contribute to this plugin. https://discord.gg/4EQRWxY3Wb

I do not have much time to work on this right now, prs welcome if you have a desired change.
